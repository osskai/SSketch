# SSketch

This project is based on [xibyte/jsketcher](https://github.com/xibyte/jsketcher), 
but based on the Typescript language. And I have also used the codes from others,
such as the undo/redo command [threejs/editor](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js),
and others, and the constraint solver [solvespace](https://github.com/solvespace/solvespace). 

This project is just a demo currently, please download it and
run in your web. Enjoy it.
